  Description:
    Abstract:
      This dataset contains data representing streams and shorelines in Illinois and portions of surrounding states as derived from US Geological Survey 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph files, hydrography layer, 1980-1986.  This includes all the DLG streams data that ISGS/IDNR customarily stored by county prior to 2004.  Polygon topology is not included (i.e. Lakes can not be identified or shaded).  Many class 1 streams are not included. Edgematching and generation of polygon topology for lakes and large rivers is incomplete.

      Publication dates of the USGS maps used as sources range from 1980 to 1986.  The maximum estimated error in horizontal position based on National Map Accuracy Standards is 167 feet.  Experience shows that actual locational error appears to be greater, especially in localized areas.

      Attributes include feature type and coincidence, among others.

      The data are stored in geographic coordinates, NAD83.

      These data have not been updated since 1986 (except in one isolated instance), nor are there plans to do so.  Accordingly, these data are for general reference and cartographic use.  This is a legacy dataset made available as a convenience.  The data are not suitable for showing all local streams or shorelines at a large scale for any given area.  These data can be considered to be essentially out of date and unmaintained.

      These data and most of the accompanying metadata were originally developed and maintained under the auspices of the Illinois Geographic Information System (IGIS) initiative (circa 1986).  Maintenance of the metadata was transferred to ISGS circa 1996.
    Purpose:
      These data are primarily intended as a cartographic element on maps for spatial reference.

      This dataset serves as an important base cartographic element for many types of maps and has been widely distributed and used outside the ISGS.  The data set was not and is not intended as a substitute for surveyed locations, such as can be determined by a registered Public Land Surveyor.  Although useful in a GIS as a reference base layer for maps, the data set has no legal basis in the definition of boundaries or property lines.
    Supplemental_Information: Edition 1.0 of this dataset was updated by conversion to the ArcSDE data storage model, metadata update, and appending coverage data for the 102 counties in Illinois into a single feature class.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: No report.  Consult source DLG information.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Data set is topologically structured linear data however data have not been thoroughly edgematched and are not a topologically complete representation of the hydrologic network. Pseudo nodes and discontinuities exist on many arcs.
  Completeness_Report: Dataset is incomplete.  No statement of completeness was provided with the original USGS DLG data. Visual inspection and comparison with other larger scale sources suggests that many first and second order streams are not included. The level of detail (completeness) varies across quad (module) boundaries due to the variation in the original DLG data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Data corrected for Pike and Scott counties.  Eleven stream arcs occurred in the northeast corner of the Pike county streams coverage that should actually be in the Scott county streams coverage.  It is assumed that this was caused by clipping the original statewide streams coverage with an incorrect county boundary.  The fix was performed in ArcEdit 7x by selecting the arcs in the Pike coverage and PUTting them into the Scott coverage.
      Process_Date: 20021022
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The 102 county-by-county coverages stored as <county_name>/streams were appended using Arc/Info 7.2.1 on a UNIX workstation.  The process was automated with an AML program.  The command was:

        Arc: append streams line features
        (the 102 coverages were listed here)
        end

        The new coverage was reprojected from customary ISGS Lambert projection, NAD27 to geographic coordinates, NAD83, double-precision.  That coverage was imported into ISGS SDE enterprise database, following steps outlined in ISGS procedure GISDB_0009.

        Spatial index grid size was set at 0.125 degrees.

        Metadata was updated.

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Attribute items are in typical ArcSDE feature class format.  Those requiring additional explanations are:

      ENR1, ENR2, ENR
      ENR1 and ENR2 are concatenated to create ENR
      Code composed of one or two parts describing the type of feature represented. Derived from original  coding in DLG files.  From Standards for Digital Line Graphs, USGS, 1987.

      Values for ENR1 include:
      200  -  shoreline
      201  -  manmade shoreline
      203  -  indefinite shoreline
      204  -  apparent limit, delineates patterned areas on quads
      412  -  stream
      414  -  ditch of canal
      415  -  aqueduct
      418  -  siphon
      419* -  boundary of a channel in a waterbody

      Values for ENR2 include:
      406  -  dam
      407  -  canal lock or sluice gate
      409  -  gate (flood, tidal, head, check)
      605  -  right bank
      606  -  left bank
      610  -  intermittent
      611  -  abandoned

      These codes are not consistent with USGS coding but were added by IGIS staff to originally unattributed arcs.

      Special cases of minor code values:
      202 (closure): This value appears both alone and as a modifier for streams (412) and ditches (414).  This code is maintained as 202 in ENR2.  ENR codes containing 202 include 000202, 412202 & 414202.

      406 (dams): This value appears both alone and as a modifier to shorelines (200). This code is maintained as 406 in ENR2. Possible codes include 000406 and 200406.

      602 (overpassing)
      617 (underpassing): These descriptors are modifiers for a number of feature types including siphons (418), streams (412) and ditches (414).  They are carried in item OV-UN. 1 indicates overpassing and 2 indicates underpassing.

      Precedence:
      In a few limited cases, information coded in the original data was discarded due to how the codes were restructured. These situations are resolved as follows:

      intermittent and closure line are coded as closure lines (202)
      intermittent and abandoned are coded as intermittent (610)
      414 610 202 ditch intermittent closure. Closure supersedes
      414 610 611 ditch intermittent abandoned. Interim. supersedes

      OV-UN
      Overpassing indicates a feature that passes over rather than intersects another feature, such as an aqueduct. Note that this is not maintained topologically.  Underpassing indicates a feature passing under another feature, such as an aqueduct. from Standards for Digital Line Graphs, USGS, 1987.
      Domain:      0 - Neither
                         1 - overpassing
                         2 - underpassing

      COINCIDENT
      DLG feature code indicating the type of feature in other DLG data sets with which this arc is coincident.  This attribute was carried over form the original DLG data set and has not been checked or maintained.  Refer to USGS DLG Users Guide. from Standards for Digital Line Graphs, USGS, 1987.  Domain: See USGS DLG Users Guide 2.
